              <H2>Behaviour and life cycle</h2>
			    
                     
					 <p>Mammalian reproduction is sexual and by internal fertilization, which involves copulation between the male
 and the female, Mammals are also characterized by the offspring's dependence on its parents. In any case, there is
 a group of mammals called monotremes that is oviparous; that is, its members reproduce by laying egg. 
 Mammalian behaviour consists of a mixture of inherited components and components that can be shaped by learning.
 Parto of this process is accomplished through play, since the young use such encounters to practise jumping, biting, hunting
 and other survival skills. You will discover this and much more when yout turn the page.<p/>
<br/>

    
                        <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
                           
                               <p>Birth, maturity, reproduction and death: this life cycle has certain particularities among
mammals. As a general rule, the larger a mammal, the longer the longer the member of its species
tend to live but the fewer offspring are born to a single female per litter or reproductive 
season. Most mammals, including humans, are placental mammals; their vital functions are fully
developed inside the body of the mother.</p>

                    
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    
                        <h3>Beauty and Height</h3>
                          
                              <p>Finding a female with a whom to mate is the great effort of the male's life, a compettion
with other males of his own species. Each animal has its particular nuances. For stags, antlers
play a fundamental role in winning the heart of their choosen one. Whichever stags has the most
beautiful longest and sharpest horns will be winner. Thus, he will be able to defend his territory,
court the female and reproduce.</p>

                    
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
               
                          <h3>Oviparous Mammals</h3>
                            
                                 <p>For a mammal to lay eggs seems improbable, but the surprising monotreme females, instead of giving
birth to young, are oviparous. They are warm-blooded, have hair, and feed their newborn through mammary
glands despite having no nipples. Playtypuses seem like a cocktail of nature, inasmuch as parts of their
bodies resembles those of other types of animals. The other monoremes, echidnas, are covered with spines
and their young grow in mother's pouch.
                                   </p>
                    
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                   
                        <H3>Efficient Nursery</h3>
                         
                              <p>Marsupial females carry their newborn offspring in their marsupium,  a pouch attached to their belly.
The offspring are not very well developed when they come into the world after gestation period that varies
from two to five weeks. Upon emerging,  the offspring must immediatly climb with their front paws to the
marsupium to survive. Once inside, they will be protected. They are continually supplied with milk through
their mother's four teats, helping their complete their growth before leaving the pouch for the outside world.
                                </p>

                    
<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>					 
                  
                        <h3>Miraculous Placenta</h3>

                              <p>The reproductive group are formed by placental mammals, in which the unborn offspring develop in the female's
uterus. During gestation, food and oxygen pass from the mother to the fetus through an organ knows as the placenta,
which allows the exchange of substances through the blood. At birth, the offspring often have no hair, and deaf and 
blind, and feed on milk secreted by the female's mammary glands, which become active after birth.
                                </p>

<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>					 
                    
                        <h3>The First Days</h3>
                           
                              <p>
Mammals whose offspring develop within the uterus devote a lot of attention to their young compared with other animals,
because their pups are unable to live on their on at birth. That is why they are cleaned, fed and warmed. Dogs have various
developmental stages. First is the neonatal stage, which last from the opening of the pups' eyes until they begin to hear.
Then comes the socialization stage, which runs from days 21 go 70, and, finally, the juvenile stage, from 70 days on.
                               </p>
                     
<br />
<br/>
<br/>
                    
                        <h3>Development and Growth</h3>
						   
                             <p>
Play is much more than entertainment for young mammals, This activity, which may appear to have no specific purpose,
simultaneously acquiring the basics means of survival. In their games, chimpanzees perform primary instinctive activities.
 These include using tools, balancing in trees, and forming communication. Young chimpanzees express themselves by means of
 sounds, facial gestures, and body postures that they imitate from adults. Play also allows them to develop their muscles
 strength and achieve good motor coordination.
                                 </p>

                        <h3>Meat Eaters</h3>
                         
							  <p>The carnivore group is composed of species whose diet is based on hunting animals.<br/>
							  The kind of teeth they have help them efficiently cut and tear the flesh of their captured
							  prey. Lions, the most sociable of the felines, have good vision and sharp hearing; they live 
							  in packs, and when they go hunting, they do as a group.
							  
                                </p>
                   
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>					 
					
					     <h3>Herbivore</h3>
						   
						     <p>Ruminants, such as cow, sheep, or deer, have stomach made of four chambers with which
							 they carry out a unique kind of digestion. Because these animals needs to eat large quantities of
							 grass in very short times - or else be easy targets for predators - they have developed a digestive
							 system that allows them to swallow food, store it, and then return it to the mouth to chew calmly.
							 When animals carry out this activity they are said to ruminate.
							     </p>
					
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>					 
					
					     <h3>The Great Chain</h3>
						   
						     <p>Maintaining the ecological balance requires the existence of prey and predators. Predators species
							 bring about a sustain reduction in the numbers of individuals of the prey species. If predators did
							 not exist, their prey would probably proliferate until the ecosystem collapsed, because probably there
							 would not be enough food for them all. Disappearance of predators is the cause of many imbalance created
							 in certain habitats by humans, whose predatory ability exceeds that of any other living species. Like all
							 other animal species, mammals do not make up food chains in themselves, instead depending at all times on
							 the participation of plants and other animals.
							      </p>
					 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>					 
					
					     <h3>One For All</h3>
						     
						    <p>Meerkats are small mammals that live in underground colonies, posting guards while the mothers
							take care of their young. During the day they go above ground to feed, and at night they go into the
							burrow to take refuge from cold. In this large family, made up of dozens of members, each one fulfils
							a function. When faced with danger, they employ various tactics to defend themselves. One of these is
							the squeal that lookouts emit in the face of even slight dangers.
