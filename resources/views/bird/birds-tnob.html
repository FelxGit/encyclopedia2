	  <h2>The Nature Of Birds</h2>
			 
<font size="5"><p>Many scientist maintain that birds descended from dinosaurs because fossils of dinosaur specimens with
feather have been found. As a group, birds have exceptional eyesight - they have the largest eyes in relation
to the size of their bodies. In addition, they have very light bones, which are suitable for flight. Just like
their bills, birds' feet have also changed in accordance with the function and particular needs of each species. For
instance, walking birds - like other vertebrate group - display a marked tendency towards having a reduced number
of toes; ostriches, for example, have only two. Some birds of prey, such as eagles, have feet that are varitable
    hooks. </p>
<br/>
   
             
                        <h3>Skeleton and Musculature</h3>
                           
                               <p>Both lightweight and resistant, the skeleton of birds underwent important changes
							   in order to adapt to flight. Some bones, like those of the skull and wings, fused to
							   become lighter. Birds have fewer bones than vertebrates. Because their bones are hollow,
							    containing internal air chambers, the total weight of their bones is less than that of
								their feather. Birds' spines tend to be very flexible in the cervical region and rigid
								neart the rib cage, where a large keel, to which the pectoral muscles attach. These large,
								strong muscles are used for flapping the wings. In contrast, running birds, such as ostriches, 
								have more developed muscles on their legs.</p>

                    
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                   
                        <h3>Internal Organs</h3>
                           
                              <p>Birds in flight can consume oxygen at a rate that a well-trained athlete would not be able to withstand for even a fewer
							  minutes. Because of this oxygen consumption, all their organs have had to adapt. The lungs of birds, though smaller than
							  those of mammals of similar size, are much more efficient. Their lungs have several air sacks that both increase
							  the efficiency of their respiratory systems and make them lighter. A special feature of the digestive system is a crop 
							  in the oesophagus, where food is stored for digestion or for feeding the young. A bird's heart can be four times larger
							  in relation to its body size than a human's in relation to its body size.</p>

                   
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                   
                          <h3>The Senses</h3>
                          
                                 <p>In birds, the senses organs are concentrated on the head, except for the sense of touch, which
								 is found all over the body. Birds have the largest size with respect to the size of their bodies. 
								 This enable to see distant objects with considerable percision. Their field of vision is very broad,
								 over 300 degrees, but in general they have little binocular vision. The ear - a simple orifice, but
								 very refined in nocturnal hunters - helps them notice sounds in audible to humans, which facilatates 
								 the detection of prey while flying. The senses of touch and smell, on the other hand, are important
								 only to some birds, and the sense of taste is almost nonexistent.</p>
                                   
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

                     
					     <h3>Feathers</h3>
						    
						    <p>Feathers are the feature that distinguishes birds from all other animals. They make
							birds strikingly colourful, protect them against cold and intense heat, enable them to
							move easily through the air and water and hide them from enemies Feathers are also one
							of the reasons why humans being have domesticated, caught and hunted birds. A bird's set
							of feathers is called its plumage, and its colour is essential for reproductive success.</p>
					
<br />
<br/>
<br/>					 
                  
                        <h3>Wings to Fly</h3>
                          
						   
                              <p>Wings are highly modified arms that, through their unique structures and shape,enable
							  most birds to fly. There are many types of wings; they vary by species. For instance, penguins,
							  which are flightless. use their wings for the specialized task of swimming. Among all wings that
							  have existed in the animal kingdom, those of birds are the best for flying. Their wings are light
							  and durable, and in some cases their shape and effectiveness can be modified during flight. To
							  understand the relationship between wings and a bird's weight, the concept of wing loading, which
							  helps explain the type of flight for each species, is useful.</p>

                    
<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>					 
                    
                        <h3>Type of Tail</h3>
                        

                              <p>Over the course of evolution, birds' tail vertebrate fused into a pegostyle,
							  and in their place feather of different sizes and colours emerged. These feathers
							  have multiple uses: they can control aerial manoeuvres during flight, works as
							  brakes during landing and makes noise. Males also use them during courtship to
							  dazzle and win over females. Usually, the tail is formed by rectrices that vary
							  in number, length and rigidity depending on the species.</p>
                    
<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>					 
                   
                        <h3>Gliding</h3>
                         
						   
                              <p>Involves using air currents to fly and save energy when travelling long distances.
							  There are two types of gliders, terrestrial birds and marine birds, each of which is
							  adapted to different atmospheric phenomena. Terrestrial birds rise on the thermals
							  (rising air currents). Marine Birds use oceanic surface winds. Once the birds gain
							  altitude, they glide off in straight paths. They slowly lose altitude until encountering
							  another thermal that will lift them. Both terrestrial and marine gliders have wings
							  of considerable size.
                               </p>
                    
<br/> 
<br/>
<br/>					 
                     
                        <h3>Flapping Flight</h3>
                           
                              <p>Most flying birds use flapping flight all the time. It consist of moving through
							  the air as if rowing with the wings. With each flap (raising and lowering), the wing
							  both sustain the bird in the air and pushes its body forwards. There are different types
							  of flapping flight and different rates of flapping, In general, the larger the bird, te more
							  powerful and less frequent its flapping will be. Because flapping is an activity that consumes
							  much energy, birds have adapted a variety of flight patterns: some, like hummingbirds, always
							  flap their wings, whereas others alternate flapping with short-term gliding. The wing shape
							  also varies according to the bird's needs. Birds that cover long distances have long, narrow
							  wings; those that fly among trees have short, rounded wings.
                               </p>
